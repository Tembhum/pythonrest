the owner to have all the permissions and no permissions for the group and public, you need to set the permission 700 in absolute mode:
chmod 700 filename

Change permission on all the files in a directory recursively
chmod -R 755 directory

chmod 777: Everything for everyone
chmod 777 filename

chmod +x or chmod a+x: Execution for everyone
chmod +x /path/to/file

chmod 755: Only owner can write, read and execute for everyone
chmod 755 /path/to/file

chmod 700: Everything for owner only
chmod 700 /path/to/file

chmod 666: No one executes
chmod -c 666 /path/to/file

chmod 644: Everyone can read, only owner can write
chmod 644 /path/to/file

chmod 600: Owner can read and write, nothing else for anyone
chmod 600 /path/to/file

The next step to complete the command, you either decide to add permissions bits (+), remove permissions (-), or set permission (=). This last one will add or remove permissions as needed to set permission as you requested.

chmod -v u+
The next section is where you decide the permission MODE to apply(+), remove (-) or match (=). You can specify any combination of rwx.

chmod -v u+rw
This next example will apply read/write permission to file for the owner. The verbose option will cause chmod to report on the action.

chmod -v u+rw /path/to/file
This next one will set the groupâ€™s write permission on directory and all its content recursively. It will report only on changes.

chmod -cR g+w /path/to/directory
You can combine multiple operation to be done on permission like this next example. It will make sure owner has read/write/execute, also add write permission for group and remove execution for everyone else:

chmod u=rwx,g+w,o-x /path/to/file
This last one will use rFile as a reference to set permission on file. When completed, the permission of file will be exactly as they are for rFile

chmod --reference=/path/to/rFile /path/to/file
There are more options and MODE that can be used with chmod that are not covered or mentioned here. I wanted to keep this to basic and hopefully help a few new Linux user.
